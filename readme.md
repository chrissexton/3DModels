A quick icosahedron to use as a projectile for my [Trebuchette](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1803756771/trebuchette-the-snap-together-desktop-trebuchet).

## Gear

Just doodling with gears from the [BOSL2 library](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2/wiki).

## Shelf Pin

![shelf pin](img/pin.png)

[Shelf pins](https://www.printables.com/model/352792-shelf-bracket-pin) that I made to replace broken pins in my cabinets. They seem to be hardy and doing the job. These were my first "real" project designed from scratch.

## Pliers Rack

A pliers rack that I made from scratch for my tool wall.

## Router Shim

A small shim to scoot the router forward a bit in its mount for my [Maslow CNC](https://www.maslowcnc.com).

## Screwdriver Holder

A parametric screwdriver holder based on some designs I've seen online. I printed about 5 of these for the tool wall, and they work great.
